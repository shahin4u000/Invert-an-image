# Invert-an-image
Using command line argument an image was inverted. 

command line argument is :

fruit.bmp ResultImage.bmp USE_VECTOR

One can change the method as:
USE_VECTOR, USE_VECTOR_POINTER , USE_VECTOR_REF or USE_CHAR_ARRAY. 

At a time only one method will work. That is how the code was written. But using defferent method one can easily distinguished which process is faster among vector, vector pointer, vector as reference or array. Enjoy !!!!
